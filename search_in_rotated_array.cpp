//Statement at a glance: 
//Problem Statement: Given an integer array arr of size N, sorted in ascending order (with distinct values) and a target value k. Now the array is 
//rotated at some pivot point unknown to you. Find the index at which k is present and if k is not present return -1.

    int low = 0, high = n - 1;
    while (low <= high) {

        //if mid points the target
        if (arr[mid] == k) return mid;

        //if left part is sorted:
